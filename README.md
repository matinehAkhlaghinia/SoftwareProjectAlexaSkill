# SoftwareProjectAlexaSkill


This 1st Alexa Skill was made by following the tutorial available on AWS services. 
For now the skill only ask "the user's favourite colour" and then remembers it.
Although this might seem simple, it was very difficult to deploy and declare all the running configurations and setup for the Skill.

Links that need are needed in order to deploy and set up the skill:

### Future of the Project:

The skill will be developed into a interactive application and will incorporate the dialogue between the bot and user.
